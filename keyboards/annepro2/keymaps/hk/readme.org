* Home row mod

I'm currently evaluating home mod rows.
Initially typing fast would trigger the layer key(s) and cause unintended actions.
However, once I configured ~TAPPING_TERM_PER_KEY~ and extended the tapping period for the home row it is way better.
An unforeseen small disadvantage is that holding down the home row keys does not repeat the key.
You have to tap and then tap-hold to get the key to repeat.
In a modal editing environment this can be slightly inconvenient.
Furthermore, it feels slightly more sluggish to type.
